#CONTENT TYPE DEFINITIONS

##ACTIVITY

An **activity** is an outdoor pursuit that can be performed by the general public and ultimately benefits Wildlife Resources’ mission of conserving, enhancing and promoting wildlife.

The promotion of these activities on the website—and when, where and how the public can take part in them—must be justified in at least one of two ways:

1. The activity itself will generate revenue for Wildlife Resources via a license, permit, pass, admission or fee.
2. It can be strongly argued that while the activity does not implicitly require the public to make a purchase from Wildlife Resources (though it could in certain contexts), the activity can readily be associated with activities that do.

For example, it is possible for kayakers and other types of paddlers to pass through a Wildlife Resources property without having to purchase a GORP permit. However there is also significant number of paddlers that the agency can expect a financial return from:

- Those who do need to purchase GORP permits so that they can launch or come ashore within the area
- Or those who will purchase a fishing license so that they can engage in both pursuits at the same time.

Activities cannot be designated on a map as they could encompass the entire property or could overlap with a particular feature on the property. For instance, *Fishing* is allowed practically everywhere on a Public Fishing Area. *Hiking* would overlap the feature *Hiking Trail*.

##FACILITY

##FEATURE

A **feature** is any stand-alone structure or part of the natural landscape that directly supports Wildlife Resources’ designated activities. These items can be represented on a map as an area, a line or a point/symbol/icon.

##AMENITY (vs. FEATURE)

An **amenity** improves a customer’s comfort in using a feature or taking part in an activity. Amenities are unlikely to be the criteria that the public will use to identify an opportunity for an activity therefor they will not appear verbally on the website. Instead, these items are best represented on a map either as symbols or text.

###EXAMPLES INCLUDE:

- Restrooms
- Parking Areas
- Trail Shelters

They may be organized, promoted, sponsored or endorsed, in whole or part, by Wildlife Resources.

##EVENT

An **event** is a specially organized experience, open to the public or a segment of the public, on a regular or recurring basis. An event contributes to a larger strategy or initiative within Wildlife Resources. For instance, Hunter Education Courses achieve certain goals for the Hunter Retention/Recruitment program. An event needs a consistent, year-round presence on the website. While specific details are a Calendar Listing on the Global Calendar, an event contains generic information to pique the reader's interest -- purpose, activities, outcomes, photos, etc. An event is organized, promoted, sponsored or endorsed, in whole or part, by Wildlife Resources.

##PROGRAM

A **program** is an organized and structured effort, initiative, campaign or unit within Wildlife Resources Division that strives to conserve, enhance or promote wildlife through public participation. 

A program is not a Service. Programs often have Events or other ways to invite the public into its specific area of focus. 

A program often has an official name, and sometimes, a logo. Sometimes supporting program are “owned” by an external organization with its own website. Whenever possible, this existing website should be utilized as the default source of information on the program. Information specific to and necessary for Georgia can be listed on the Wildlife Resources website. Links to external sites should open in new windows to prevent losing the visitor. 

###EXAMPLES INCLUDE:

- Juniors Acquiring Knowledge Ethics and Sportsmanship 
- National Archery in the Schools Program 
- Project Wild

##MANAGEMENT

**Management** is a large-scale operation or section within Wildlife Resources that directs ongoing conservation efforts. Not every operation is directly relevant to the public. At least one of the following questions should be answered "yes," before posting information on the website: 
- Does the public need to know about the operation to continue to participate in a program, event or activity? (Think Sportfish Restoration Act -- info would help angler understand his/her contribution to conservation for the future)
- Does the agency need public support to continue the operation? (think Bobwhite Quail)
- Does the operational staff regularly interface with the public? (think Game Management technicians and area managers)
- Will the public witness the operations and need background to understand the strategies employed? (think Prescribed Fire or Stream Team)

###EXAMPLES INCLUDE:

- Game Management
- Nongame Conservation
